## 🐛 **Known Issues & Fixes**

### **Issue: Old Teapot Icon Still Shows**

**Cause:** iOS aggressively caches Apple Touch Icons by filename

**Fix Option 1 (Quick):**
1. Delete Royal-Tea from Home Screen
2. Safari → Clear History and Website Data
3. Visit site again
4. Re-add to Home Screen
5. Crown appears! 👑

**Fix Option 2 (Permanent):**
1. Icons renamed: `icon-*.png` → `crown-*.png`
2. Completely new URLs = no cache possible
3. Deploy with renamed icons
4. Problem solved permanently
